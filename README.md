# Internship Report

This repository hosts a report from my internship focused on the Trans Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP) project at TEKFEN Engineering.

During the internship, I carried out multiple tasks mainly focused on electrical engineering aspects of the TANAP project. Here is a brief summary of the work done:

## AutoCAD & Data Transfer

- Downloaded and installed AutoCAD software. Worked on the AutoCAD(.dwg) documents of Metering Station (MS3) of TANAP project, which included lightning and small power layouts. 
- Transferred the tag information to an excel file for error detection, correction and further analysis.

## TANAP Project Understanding

- Gained insights about TANAP, its significance, the processes leading to construction, and the importance of AutoCAD drawings in the process.
- Studied the earthing calculation and layout of a utility building in a compressor station, lightning system layout, cable tray layout, small power layout and a calculation sheet to determine the cable type to use.

## Analysis & Calculations

- Analysed different stations including MS1, CS1, CS5, and MS2 for potential issues and corrections.
- Compiled the information about the distribution boards in TANAP project, like distribution board tags, incomer ratings, outgoing circuit types, outgoing feeders, incomer cable sizes coming to distribution board into an organized excel file.
- Studied the cathodic protection layout drawings and design reports and attended a presentation by an engineer about cathodic protection.
- Worked on earthing calculations for buildings of metering stations and compressor stations of TANAP project.
- Performed voltage drop calculations, cable impedance, short circuit current and cable short circuit carrying capacity calculations for the buildings in CS5 and CS1 of TANAP project.

## Error Detection & Correction

- Checked AutoCAD files and panel tag lists for errors and inconsistencies and made necessary corrections.
- Verified the corrected AutoCAD documents after the errors were fixed.

## Bill of Quantities Analysis

- Extracted electrical load information from the bill of quantities table of firefighting and instrument air works of TANAP project.
- Prepared an excel file containing the necessary information and calculation of the rated current and find corresponding cable type from the book of AFUMEX cables.

## Single Line Diagram Analysis

- Studied an overall single line diagram and extracted necessary information into an excel file.

## Building Dimensions Update

- Updated the dimensions of the buildings in stations of TANAP project as per the received documents.

At the end of the internship, I prepared a presentation about the work done during my time at TEKFEN Engineering.
